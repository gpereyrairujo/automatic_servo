It uses a servo motor to trigger a camera shutter or press a button, with an interval ranging from 5 seconds to 8 hours.

The servo is controlled by an Arduino board, and it also includes and LCD display and buttons for configuration and a buzzer to beep each time it is activated.

The electronics are mounted on a 3D-printed base, which has been designed for a thermal camera mounted on a tripod, but can be modified to fit a specific instrument and mount.
